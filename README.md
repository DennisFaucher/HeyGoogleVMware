Teaching Google Assistant to Control VMware
## Why
My electric company gave me a free Google Home for signing up and I needed to see what I could teach it to do. I have been blogging (blog.faucher.net) about interesting devlopments in VMware lately, so this seemed like a good idea.
## Requirements
* Google Home
* VMware installation. I used VMware Prallels, but vSphere could just as easily be used.
* IFTTT
* DropBox
* Keyboard Maestro for Mac (www.keyboardmaestro.com)
